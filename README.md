# Music Melee

A multiplayer 3D game that will run efficiently off a Node server using websockets. 

The game is called Music Melee (a working title) and involves fast and responsive parkour-like gameplay as players bounce around the environment and melee each other. As the name suggests, the twist is that everything in the game creates dynamic sounds (mapped out in stereo 3D) and the more chaotic the battles get, the more sonically interesting it becomes. Players can get powerups for certain musically-interesting behaviour like achieving certain harmonies or matching the rhythm of the arena (which is procedurally generated at the start of the match). Matches are 2 minutes long and then the arena resets.
